        <p>Trailblazer activities, and any materials provided by CDRED is entirely at your own risk.

CDRED does not guarantee that any information provided by trailblazers is true, accurate, or complete.</p>

        <h6>Section 6</h6>
        <p>You agree that accepting these Terms and Conditions means you consent to the Privacy Policy, which explains how CDRED collects, uses, and shares your personal information.</p>

        <h6>Section 7</h6>
        <p>You agree to protect and hold CDRED and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, consultants, representatives, and agents harmless from any claims, including legal and professional fees, related to your use of the Services, your breach of these Terms and Conditions, any User Materials or Trailblazer Activities related to your account, except in cases where the Claims are caused by CDRED' gross negligence or will ful misconduct while providing the Services.</p>

        <h6>Section 8</h6>
        <p>The agreement states that you and CDRED are giving up your rights to file claims in court, have a trial by jury, or participate in a class or representative action regarding any legal dispute arising from your use of CDRED's Services. Instead, both parties agree to resolve disputes through individual arbitration, with limited access to discovery, unless you opt out of this agreement. The term "dispute" is defined broadly and includes any disagreement or claim between you and CDRED. Before initiating arbitration, the parties must first try to resolve the dispute informally by providing written notice to the other party, describing the facts and allowing 30 days for response. Both parties agree that this informal dispute resolution process is a necessary condition before initiating arbitration against the other party. However, either party may bring an individual claim in small claims court within the jurisdictional and dollar limits, as long as it remains an individual claim.</p>

        <h6>Section 8.1</h6>
        <p>the agreement covers dispute resolution and the arbitration agreement between you and CDRED. The agreement states that both parties agree to give up any rights to litigate claims in a court or before a jury or to participate in a class action or representative action with respect to a claim, except for bringing an individual claim in small claims court. The term "dispute" covers any dispute, action, claim, or other controversy between you and CDRED, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis.</p>


        <p>If there is a dispute, either party asserting the dispute should try to resolve it by providing written notice to the other party, describing the facts and circumstances and allowing 30 days to respond. This dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against the other party.</p>

        <p>You have the right to opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within the first 30 days after you use the Services or within 30 days after being notified of a material change to this Arbitration Agreement. To opt-out, you may send an email or a letter to the specified address, including your printed name, mailing address, and the words "Reject Arbitration.</p>

        <p>In the event of arbitration, either party may initiate arbitration, which shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration hearing shall take place in the county of your residence unless otherwise agreed. All arbitrations shall proceed on an individual basis, and you and CDRED hereby waive the right to a trial by jury, to assert or participate in any class action lawsuit or class action arbitration, any private attorney general lawsuit or private attorney general arbitration, and any joint or consolidated lawsuit or joint or consolidated arbitration of any kind. CDRED will pay all filing, administrative, arbitrator, and hearing costs, except for a dispute determined to be initiated in bad faith or frivolous by the arbitrator, and waives any rights it may have to recover an award of attorneys' fees and expenses against you. If applicable law precludes enforcement of any of these limitations as to a particular cause of action, then that cause of action (and only that cause of action) must remain in court and be severed from any arbitration.</p>

        <h6>Section 8.2</h6>
        <p>of the agreement states that the Federal Arbitration Act and the law of the State of Pennsylvania will govern and enforce the arbitration agreement. The terms of the arbitration agreement will continue even after the end of the customer's relationship with CDRED and use of its services. The arbitration proceedings will be confidential, and neither party can disclose the details of the arbitration unless required by law. Any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>If any part of the arbitration agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not affect the rest of the agreement. The arbitrator is the only one authorized to determine the validity and enforceability of the agreement, but the validity of the class action/representative waiver must be decided by a court.</p>

        <p>In <b>Section 8.3</b> it is stated that if any part of the arbitration agreement is unenforceable by Canadian laws, disputes between Canadian residents and CDRED will be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the applicable federal laws of Canada, excluding any rules of private international law or conflicts of laws that would lead to the application of other laws.</p>
